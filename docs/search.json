I was also the vice president of the Outdoor Adventures Club, helping to organize caving trips and hikes for the club’s hundreds of members. During my internships with Syngenta I experienced the industry side of research, which has been invaluable as I progress through my professional journey. I am excited to continue my on this path in Dr. Chavez’s lab at UGA, where I will be contributing to genetic and phenotypic research on peaches.\nI look forward to seeing what’s next as I continue to explore the fields of agriculture and horticulture!"

I am working in the lab of Dr. Dario Chavez under the umbrella of the Institute of Plant Breeding, Genetics, and Genomics.\n\nLabs\nDuring my time at UA I was a member of two labs; I worked with Dr. McKain studying invasive Johnson grass and with Dr. Benstead investigating freshwater macro invertebrate ecology.\nIn the McKain lab, I worked with a team of graduate and undergraduate students to collect samples, isolate DNA, and construct genetic libraries with the goal of understanding the mode of invasion of Johnson grass in the southeastern United States. A fellow undergraduate and I presented this poster at UA’s Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities conference.\nIn the Benstead lab, I worked with a PhD student to sort through freshwater stream samples and isolate macro invertebrates. The goal of the project was to determine the effect of stream warming on invertebrate populations and, by extension, freshwater ecosystems as a whole.\nIn the Chavez lab, I am currently working to assemble a phylogeny of peach cultivars."

This involved learning the programs SmartSheet and LucidChart, which were used by Syngenta to create records of every employee who received on-the-job training. I spent the summer contacting site leads and visiting sites across the Midwest to learn how we could improve the current system and accommodate every employee, including seasonal workers. The internship culminated in a presentation of my results to Syngenta’s regional leaders and my fellow interns.\n\n\nSeeds Operations Intern, Syngenta\nDuring my time as the Seeds Operations Intern in Slater, IA, I learned about the more hands-on aspects of agricultural research. In corn and soybean fields I planted seed trials, led teams to take tissue samples and hand pollinate, and took notes on variety performance. Indoors I organized germplasm for genetic analysis, prepared seed requested by breeders, and prepared trial field layouts. I enjoyed the opportunity to experience both the corporate and field sides of agricultural research."
