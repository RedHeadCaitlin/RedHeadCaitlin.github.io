## Internships

### NA R&D Stewardship Intern, [Syngenta](https://www.syngenta.com/en)

As the North America Stewardship Intern in Downers Grove, IL, my assignment was the streamlining and standardizing of stewardship documents across all North American locations. This involved learning the programs SmartSheet and LucidChart, which were used by Syngenta to create records of every employee who received on-the-job training. I spent the summer contacting site leads and visiting sites across the Midwest to learn how we could improve the current system and accommodate every employee, including seasonal workers. The internship culminated in a presentation of my results to Syngenta's regional leaders and my fellow interns.

### Seeds Operations Intern, [Syngenta](https://www.syngenta.com/en)

During my time as the Seeds Operations Intern in Slater, IA, I learned about the more hands-on aspects of agricultural research. In corn and soybean fields I planted seed trials, led teams to take tissue samples and hand pollinate, and took notes on variety performance. Indoors I organized germplasm for genetic analysis, prepared seed requested by breeders, and prepared trial field layouts. I enjoyed the opportunity to experience both the corporate and field sides of agricultural research.
