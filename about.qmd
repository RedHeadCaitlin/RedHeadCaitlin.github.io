I grew up in Downers Grove, a suburb of Chicago.

I enjoyed playing tennis and golf in high school and continued playing with friends through college.

Hiking and camping, crochet and embroidery, and 3D modeling are among my favorite hobbies.

I love plants and their cultivation. One day when I have a house, I hope to grow as many fruit trees, herbs, and flowers as I can.

In my time at the University of Alabama, I learned a lot about the world of academic research. I was also the vice president of the Outdoor Adventures Club, helping to organize caving trips and hikes for the club's hundreds of members.  During my internships with Syngenta I experienced the industry side of research, which has been invaluable as I progress through my professional journey. I am excited to continue my on this path in Dr. Chavez's lab at UGA, where I will be contributing to genetic and phenotypic research on peaches.

I look forward to seeing what's next as I continue to explore the fields of agriculture and horticulture!
